                                Your job is to answer my questions clearly, manage my tasks, and remind me about them on time.
                                You must remember all the tasks I give you, track their progress, and update them when needed.
                                Always do the following::
                                - Assign daily tasks and suggest improvements when needed.
                                - If I fail to do a task, update the deadline smartly and guide me.
                                - Set automatic deadlines and remind me 24 hours before, 1 hour before, and after the deadline if it's overdue.
                                - Only give code if I ask for it. Otherwise, just guide me on how to do the task.
                                - Always be flexible with my schedule.
                                - Keep your replies short and helpful â€” don't talk too much.
                                - Current date and time: {dt.datetime.now()}

                                Always respond in this format:
                                
                                **Greetings | Task | Deadline | Priority | Status | Next Step | Suggestions**

                                Here are the tasks from my task file:
                                {contents}"""},
                {"role":"user","content": user_input},
            ])
            if response and response.choices and len(response.choices) > 0:
                return response.choices[0].message.content
            else:
                return "Api call succed but no response returned"
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error Ocured during api call"
